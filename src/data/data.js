    I am looking for a job for an intern. I can work in a team, 
    but I am also comfortable with independent tasks. I am able to sacrifice my free 
    time to achive the goal, but I do not afraid ask for help too. I invite you to 
    visit my github page and give me a chance to gain experience :)`
